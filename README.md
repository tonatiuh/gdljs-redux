Here you'll find the files for the demo of my talk "What is & why Redux" at [@gdl_js](https://github.com/gdljs/gdljs/)

## Contents

You'll find two versions of the classic Todo app:
* One built with [React & Redux](https://github.com/tonatiuh/gdljs-redux/tree/master/src/todo_redux)
* One built with [React only](https://github.com/tonatiuh/gdljs-redux/tree/master/src/todo_react)

Is worth to mention that this specific exercise of the Todo app is not the one where Redux shines the most, because the excercise is not very complex.

However, is a good exercise for comparing under a simple use case what are the differences in implementation of React vs React + Redux.

## Installation
